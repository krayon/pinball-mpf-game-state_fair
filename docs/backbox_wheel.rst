Mechanical backbox toy
======================

It could be a *Scared Stiff* style mechanical wheel in the backbox. Don't exactly know what this is for yet. A prize
wheel?

Or this could be another type of carnival game? Maybe this is something like Pachinko? There could be small balls and
lots of pins, with several channels with different prizes. (The labels for the prize channels should be
interchangeable so operators can change which prizes and odds are available.)
