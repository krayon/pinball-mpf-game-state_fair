Tractor Pull
============

This mode focuses on combos, with each combo propelling the player's tractor ahead. But be careful, because each non-lit
shot they hit (standups, etc.) causes damage. (First slipping, then ultimately a broken drive train.)

This mode is not timed but ends when the player either wins or hits too many (5?) off shots. So it rewards accuracy
rather than speed.
