The Petting Zoo
===============

Animal escape!

All balls in the machine are released, and you have to lock them all.

This mode can contain the homage to the cow.

There are five balls in the machine and five places that balls can go. So all five balls are released (and
re-released if they drain) and the player has to lock all five. When the mode ends, points are awarded based on
how many you locked.

When the mode ends, the balls will be released, so it will be like multiball again, but we need a reason for
why they're released.
