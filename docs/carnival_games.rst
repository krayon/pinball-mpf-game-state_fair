Carnival Games
==============

One of the main objectives of *State Fair* is to play carnival games to get tickets.
Playing games themselves require tickets. The selected game is flashing, and you light
"Start Game" with a ramp shot, then hit the "Start Game" hole.

Carnival Games include:

   * Shooting Gallery
   * Strong Man
   * Quick Draw
   * Basketball
   * Color Match Game

*State Fair* has a physical bell and a revolving red light on the top of the backbox. Both
of these will go off when you "win" a game.

Shooting Gallery
----------------

Many shots on the playfield are lit. Each time you hit a shot, it goes out. Try to hit all
the shots. You get tickets for each shot, and bonus tickets for getting them all.

This mode uses the 7-segment display between the flippers to show the number of shots made.

Strong Man
----------

This is the game where you use the mallet to hit that thing attached to the pole which rings the
bell. *State Fair* will either have a small physical one of these in the back, or will use
lights up the habitrail on the left side of the machine.

The strong man shot is the spinner in the middle. The faster the spinner spins, the harder the
shot was hit, and the higher the lights go. A perfect shot will win immediately. Less than perfect
shots will let you try again. The lights you lit previously will decay slowly, so if you hit that
shot again quickly you can have some advantage from the leftover lights from the previous attempt.

This mode uses the 7-segment display between the flippers to show the strength of the shot, 0-99.

Quick Draw
----------

Similar to *Cactus Canyon*, a post holds the ball in the return lane just above the left flipper.
It counts down "3, 2, 1, Draw!" and then one shot is randomly lit and the ball is released. You
win lots of tickets if you make it, no tickets if you don't. One shot.

Basketball
----------

This is the game where you have a certain amount of time to make as many baskets as you can. This
is a multiball mode. The trough and plunger auto launch can deliver balls to a habitrail which
goes down the left side of the machine and has a post which can hold the balls.

When the mode starts, the trough will deliver 4 balls to that post to stage them for the player.
Balls will be released one at a time (every few secs) to the left flipper.

The upper right flipper has a hole behind it (which leads to a subway). In this mode, the upper
right flipper is automatically held in the "up" position exposing that hole which is
accessible to shots from the left flipper.

Any balls drained are put back into play (to the left flipper), and this mode has a multiball ball
save timer so the player has a set time of unlimited balls to make as many baskets at they can.

Tickets are awarded for each basket made as well as a bonus for hitting a certain number.

This mode uses the 7-segment display between the flippers to show remaining time (in seconds),
and when it's less than 10 seconds, it shows the time in tenths of seconds (like basketball
shot clocks).

Color Match Game
----------------

The four major ramp shots are all lit with a different color randomly: red, green, yellow, blue.

Each shot made cycles that shot's color to the next on one the list. The goal is to try to get
all the ramps to be the same color. The "catch" of course if that if you're getting close and
you accidentally hit a shot that was already the color you wanted, that shot will cycle to the
next color and you have to try to get all the shots that color or hit that shot three more times
to cycle it to the color you want.

Once you have the shots how you want them, you can hit the mode start hole to collect them.
Tickets will be awarded depending on how many shots you have that are the same color. Something
like:

* 2 shots match (2 tickets)
* 3 shots match (4 tickets)
* 4 shots match (8 tickets)
