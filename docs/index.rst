Welcome to State Fair Pinball!
==============================

This repository is for the State Fair pinball machine, a new machine created by
the people who are creating the `Mission Pinball Framework <http://missionpinball.org>`_.

State Fair does not exist as a real machine (though it could, and we'll probably build
on some day). The primary goal for this machine is for us to have a fun, original
machine we can use for the MPF tutorial to show you how to build your own machine.

State Fair is an original machine, though the playfield is based on the Gottlieb's
unreleased 1996 *Brooks 'n Dunn* machine, designed by Tim Seckel and Jon Norris. (We
think BnD has a great layout and it was never produced, and we needed a solid base
for State Fair, so that's why we chose that.)

State Fair is not a retheme, as we've designed it from scratch for our needs and
there are several changes from *Brooks 'n Dunn*, so really we just used that machine
as a starting point.

.. note::

   Everything here is just an early draft as our ideas come together. Lots will
   change, and we'd love your feedback too!

The Theme
---------

*State Fair Pinball* is about a State Fair! Think carnival games, demolition derbies,
livestock judging, pie-eating contests, and deep-fried food.

Game Concepts & Objectives
--------------------------

The game is all about being at a state fair, and all the things in the game are
state fair-type things.

There's a main concept of "tickets" (which are tracked per player, separate from score).
Just like a real fair, you need tickets to do things, which you earn through game play.
Several game modes are carnival games, which cost tickets to play, but also where you can
win tickets which you can then use to do more things. (So everything you do costs tickets,
but some things earn you tickets as well.)

You get to the wizard mode by doing everything in at fair, so if you're good and you
can earn lots of tickets quickly then you can move through all the modes, but if you're
not as good you might have to play some modes a few times to earn enough tickets for the
later things.

Other stuff
-----------

* Ribbons & judging
* Deep fried stuff
* Video mode for midway games, guess the weight, etc.
* Monster trucks
* Scrambler type ride, toy, it can spin with balls in it, and also open to release balls and open/close to accept them
* Day and night modes /
* Multiballs

   * Traditional
   * Add-a-ball
   * Timed unlimited
* Novelty flipper modes

   * Weak
   * No hold
   * Reverse
   * Invert (button push releases flipper)
* Power outage mode. Could have a cool light show effect of colored lights
  blowing up with bright white flashes.
