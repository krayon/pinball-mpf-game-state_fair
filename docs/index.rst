Welcome to State Fair Pinball!
==============================

This repository is for the *State Fair Pinball* machine, a new machine currently being
conceived by the people who are creating the `Mission Pinball Framework <http://missionpinball.org>`_
(MPF).

The theme of the machine is a state fair. (Duh!) Think carnival games, demolition derbies,
livestock judging, pie-eating contests, amusement rides, and deep-fried food.

*State Fair Pinball* is designed to be a "teaching machine"—ultimately a complete game
that we can use for the MPF tutorial.

Of course it would be fun to actually build a physical *State Fair Pinball* machine—something
we'll probably do at some point. Our goal is to not use any licensed content and to
make all the plans, assets, designs, etc. available for free. So if you want to build
your own (or use the base plans for your own) then you're free to.

.. note::

   Everything here is just an early draft as our ideas come together. Lots will
   change, and we'd love your feedback too!

Playfield Design
----------------

While *State Fair Pinball* is an original machine, we based the playfield on
Gottlieb's unreleased 1996 *Brooks 'n Dunn* (BnD) machine, designed by Tim Seckel and Jon
Norris. We think BnD has a great layout and it was never produced, and we needed a solid base
for *State Fair Pinball*, so we used the general layout as our starting point.

That said, *State Fair Pinball* is not a retheme per se, as the LED inserts are different
and we have made several changes. But you can definitely see that the starting point was BnD.

Game Concepts & Objectives
--------------------------

*State Fair Pinball* attempts to capture the experience of being at a state fair. All of
the game modes are based on things you do at a fair, including riding attractions,
playing carnival games, and eating food.

One of the central concepts of the game is "tickets" (which are tracked per player, separate from score).
Just like a real fair, you need tickets to do things, which you earn through game play.
Several game modes are carnival games, which cost tickets to play, but also where you can
win tickets which you can then use to do more things. (So everything you do costs tickets,
but some things earn you tickets as well.)

You get to the wizard mode by doing everything in at fair, so if you're good and you
can earn lots of tickets quickly then you can move through all the modes, but if you're
not as good you might have to play some modes a few times to earn enough tickets for the
later things.

Other stuff
-----------

* Ribbons & judging
* Deep fried stuff
* Video mode for midway games, guess the weight, etc.
* Monster trucks
* The stage (with videos, music, bands, the contests, etc.)
* Scrambler type ride, toy, it can spin with balls in it, and also open to release balls and open/close to accept them
* Day and night modes
* Multiballs (needs all styles)

   * Traditional
   * Add-a-ball
   * Timed unlimited
* Novelty flipper modes

   * Weak
   * No hold
   * Reverse
   * Invert (button push releases flipper)
* Power outage mode. Could have a cool light show effect of colored lights
  blowing up with bright white flashes.
