Skill Shots
===========

*State Fair* has a mechanical sprint plunger (with auto launcher) which allows
for several skill shot options.

The plunger lane leads to the right ramp which loops around the back of the
machine. There's a mini-playfield in the upper center of the machine that the
right ramp loops through.

The mini-playfield is a shooting gallery with a 2" flipper and 4
individually-controlled drop targets. There is a channel behind the drop
targets, so if the player misses a target, the ball falls down behind them
and off the mini playfield.

There's also a drain hole near the tip of the flipper where the ball can
drop down to the main playfield.

For the skill shot:

* A full plunger shot sends the ball all the way past the shooting gallery
  and down the left side of the machine to the left flipper.
* A medium plunger shot sends the ball to the shooting gallery.
* A light plunger shot sends the ball part way up the right ramp where it then
  rolls back down into the playfield.

Regular Skill Shot
------------------

Medium plunge to get the ball to drop in the shooting gallery hole.

Super Skill Shot
----------------

Medium plunge to the shooting gallery. All drop targets are up, and hit as
many as you can.

Super Secret Skill Shot
-----------------------

Hold the left flipper button and plunge. All drop targets go down except one,
and you have to hit that one. When you hit it, another one randomly pops up,
and you go as long as you can but there's only one drop target up at any given
time.
