Skill Shots
===========

*State Fair Pinball* does not have a mechanical spring plunger, so the skill
shot options will need to be based on shots hit.

Regular Skill Shot
------------------

Similar to *Ghostbusters*, the player can use the left and right flippers to
"call their shot" for the skill shot. We should make it so that all shots have
to be completed before they're reset so a player doesn't keep hitting the same
shot over and over.

Video-based Skill Shot
----------------------

Similar to *Champion Pub*, we can have an option where the player holds down the
launch button and then releases when the prize they want is selected. It would
be annoying to have this running at the same time as the regular skill shot, so
maybe this is used only to launch additional balls in certain modes.

Super Secret Skill Shot
-----------------------

We could add some kind of advanced skill shot where the player's skill shot prize
is doubled (or something) if they immediately hit a combo after hitting the skill
shot.
