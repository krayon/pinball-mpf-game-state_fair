Combos
======

We want to track combos (and a combo champ), awarded when a player hits a lit shot (lit with the red arrows)
within a shot time after hitting a shot that returns the balls to the flippers. Points can be awarded for
chaining these together, 3X, 4X, 5X, etc.

*The Shadow* used a left orbit to upper right flipper combo, with additional combos when the right flipper
to inner left orbit is hit over and over. This is fun and something we should add to SFP.
