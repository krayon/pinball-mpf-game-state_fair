Tickets
=======

A central concept of *State Fair* is tickets.

Tickets are used to start many of the game modes (which are midway
games and fair attractions that you need tickets to play). Some of the
modes let you earn tickets, and some are things you need to spend tickets
to do just to play. (Eventually you have to do everything to get to
wizard mode.)

The number of tickets a player has at all times will be plainly
visible and as obvious as their score. Ideas currently are that it's
either (1) a large 7-segment numeric display in the right rear corner,
or (2) an EM-style score reel display in the backbox. (Or both?) We'll
also make it clear on the DMD when tickets are awarded.

The player starts with a certain number of tickets (operator
configurable). Something like 4.

You get tickets for all the things you'd expect, like:

* Skill shot (4 tickets)
* Super skill shot (1 extra ticket for each target you hit, and 4 extra
  if you get them all down)
* Combo (1 ticket for a 2-way combo, then 1 more for each combo chain you
  add on).

Many of the modes will also award tickets depending on how you do in the
mode.

Wristband Mode
--------------

One of the prizes in the game will be a "wristband" which gets you
unlimited access to the attractions without needing tickets for a
certain amount of time. (Something like 30secs of non-mode game
play.) So to start the super mode which costs 100 tickets, either
earn that many tickets or start it while you have the wristband.

Ticket Bets
-----------

Some modes will allow you to wager your tickets. (There's a horse race
mode, for example.) Others will let you bet on skill. e.g. "If you can
hit this shot in one flip, you win 50 tickets, but if you miss, you
lose 20 tickets. Yes or No?"

Ticket Champion
---------------

The number of tickets will go up and down throughout the course of the
game as the player wins and spends them. But the game will track how
many total tickets the player has earned over the course of the game,
and a "TICKET CHAMP" high score category will be tracked.

End of Ball Bonus
-----------------

The total number of tickets a player has earned will be one of the
things that End of Ball Bonus is calculated on.

Ticket Buy-in
-------------

There will be an operator setting that enables a special "Buy-in"
button on the cabinet that lets you buy more tickets during a game.
(Something like 10 tickets for 25 cents)

Game Over
---------

When the game ends, you should be given the opportunity to "buy" something
on your way out with your tickets. An extra ball, or play a light & sound show,
or the ability to fire the knocker, flash the light, or ring the bell,
the ability to impress your friends with fake initial entry, leave them for
the next player to "find" somewhere, etc.
