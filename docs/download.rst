===========================

*State Fair Pinball* is hosted on GitHub. You can browse it online

Download the `latest zip <https://github.com/missionpinball/state_fair/archive/master.zip>`_
which is the MPF machine folder (as well as these docs).

Note that at this point, *State Fair Pinball* doesn't exist. The MPF config
is literally an empty folder.
