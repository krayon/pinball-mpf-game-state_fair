Fair Attractions (Modes)
========================

*State Fair* has lots of attractions that need to be played to get to
wizard mode. All of the attractions take tickets to start, and most of
them you can win tickets.

* Demolition derby
* Pie eating contest
* Catch the escaped animals form the petting zoo

Demolition Derby
----------------

Smash other cars. Probably will use the kicking targets. You have to back
into cars so you don't break your engine, so maybe you have to backhand
those shots.

Pie Eating Contest
------------------

How many times and how fast you can hit one shot. But too fast or you'll
choke!

Catch the Escaped Animals
-------------------------

All balls in the machine are released, and you have to lock them all.

This mode can contain the homage to the cow.
