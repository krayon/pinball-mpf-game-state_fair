Playfield Description
=====================

While we'd love to completely design *State Fair Pinball* from scratch, we realize that we're "software people" and
not "mechanical engineering" or "playfield layout" people.

So the *State Fair Pinball* machine we're building is a retheme of Bally's 1994 *The Shadow* pinball machine.

"Re-theming" means that we take an existing machine and completely strip it down to the bare wood, and then replace
all the art with original art. (Sort of like how Stern's *Shrek* is a retheme of *Family Guy*â€”same mechanical and
physical layouts, but completely different games.

Our goal is to make the retheme process as easy as possible, which means keeping the physical changes of the machine
to a minimum. Luckily we can use *The Shadow* almost as is. We'll have to make some minor changes like replacing the
Phurba ramp diverters with State Fair-themed ones, and swapping out the figurines, but everything else pretty much works
as is. (The Battlefield is a perfect State Fair shooting gallery!)

We'll also keep the inserts as they are, including the colored inserts. However we'll replace the lamps under the
clear inserts with RGB LEDs which will give us the option to change their colors. We'll also replace the rings with
RGB LEDs and add more LEDs on the top site of the playfield since state fairs have lots of lights.

Here's a diagram of the playfield with the lights in the colors they are. The rainbow lights are RGB LEDs:
