Backbox Features
================

* Scared Stiff style backbox spinner
* Revolving red light on top of the backbox
* Real mechanical bell on the side (or top) of the backbox
* EM-style score reels (probably modern steppers) in the backbox to show the player's current
  ticket count.
* 128x32 RGB LED DMD in the backbox

Modularity
----------

Since *State Fair Pinball* is a teaching machine, we expect that people might want to build their own,
but that they also might not want to include all of the physical components (some of which are complex and/or
expensive). So we'll be sure that the bigger external things (mechanical backbox stuff, etc.) are optional,
and we'll show people how to configure their operator menus to enable/disable things. (In other words, we'll
treat these things like optional mods.)
