Playfield Description
=====================

While *State Fair Pinball* is an original machine, we based the playfield on
Gottlieb's unreleased 1996 *Brooks 'n Dunn* (BnD) machine, designed by Tim Seckel and Jon
Norris. We think BnD has a great layout and it was never produced, and we needed a solid base
for *State Fair Pinball*, so we used the general layout as our starting point.

That said, *State Fair Pinball* is not a retheme per se, as the LED inserts are different
and we have made several changes. But you can definitely see that the starting point was BnD.

* Five flippers
* 3 pop bumpers
* 2 banks of drop targets
* 2 ramps
* 2 subways
* Auto/manual plunger
* 2-digit seven segment display between the flippers used for modes (timers, shots made, etc.)
* Scared-stiff leaper-style standups (because they're fun and carnival like)
* Full LCD screen in a "stage" on the playfield above the pop bumpers for fair shows like bands,
  pie-eating, demolition derby, etc.
* Hero shot toy is some type of ride which can do three things when hit:

   * Return the ball to the player
   * Hold the ball for a lock
   * Drop the ball down into the subway (Where it's sent to the lower left VUK)
