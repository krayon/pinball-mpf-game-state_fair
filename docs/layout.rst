Playfield Layout
================

* Five flippers
* 3 pop bumpers
* 2 banks of drop targets
* 2 ramps
* 2 subways
* Auto/manual plunger
* 2-digit seven segment display between the flippers used for modes (timers, shots made, etc.)
* Scared-stiff leaper-style standups (because they're fun and carnival like)
* Full LCD screen in a "stage" on the playfield above the pop bumpers for fair shows like bands,
  pie-eating, demolition derby, etc.
* Hero shot toy is some type of ride which can do three things when hit:
   * Return the ball to the player
   * Hold the ball for a lock
   * Drop the ball down into the subway (Where it's sent to the lower left VUK)

Cabinet Features
----------------

* Scared Stiff style backbox spinner
* Revolving red light on top of the backbox
* Real mechanical bell on the side (or top) of the backbox
* EM-style score reels (probably modern steppers) in the backbox to show the player's current
  ticket count.
* 128x32 RGB LED DMD in the backbox

Modularity
----------

Since *State Fair Pinball* is a teaching machine, we expect that people might want to build their own,
but that they also might not want to include all of the physical components (some of which are complex and/or
expensive). So we'll be sure that the bigger external things (mechanical backbox stuff, etc.) are optional,
and we'll show people how to configure their operator menus to enable/disable things. (In other words, we'll
treat these things like optional mods.)
