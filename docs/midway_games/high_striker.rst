Strong Man Mallet Pole (Midway Game)
====================================

Hit a shot over and over, with each shot adding to the lights, and a slow decay if shots aren't made
fast enough. We can add a hardware toy with LEDs which shows the progress.

Or can we install an accelerometer behind the ball lock wall and detect how hard that shot is hit?
