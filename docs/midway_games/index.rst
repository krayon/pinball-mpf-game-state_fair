Carnival Games (Modes)
======================

One of the main objectives of *State Fair* is to play midway games to win tickets.
Playing games themselves require tickets. The selected game is flashing, and you light
"Start Game" with a ramp shot, then hit the "Start Game" hole.



*State Fair* has a physical bell and a revolving red light on the top of the backbox. Both
of these will go off when you "win" a game.
