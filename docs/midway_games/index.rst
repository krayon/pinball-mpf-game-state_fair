Carnival Games (Modes)
======================

One of the main objectives of *State Fair* is to play carnival games to get tickets.
Playing games themselves require tickets. The selected game is flashing, and you light
"Start Game" with a ramp shot, then hit the "Start Game" hole.

Carnival Games include:

   * Shooting Gallery
   * Strong Man
   * Quick Draw
   * Basketball
   * Color Match Game

*State Fair* has a physical bell and a revolving red light on the top of the backbox. Both
of these will go off when you "win" a game.
