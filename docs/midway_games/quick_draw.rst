Quick Draw (Midway Game)
========================

Similar to *Cactus Canyon*, a post holds the ball in the return lane just above the right flipper.
It counts down "3, 2, 1, Draw!" and then one shot is randomly lit and the ball is released. Player
win lots of tickets if you make it, no tickets if you don't. One shot.
